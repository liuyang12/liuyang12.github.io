abstract = "Multimodal microscopy offers high flexibilities for biomedical observation and diagnosis. Conventional multimodal approaches either use multiple cameras or a single camera spatially multiplexing different modes. The former needs expertise demanding alignment and the latter suffers from limited spatial resolution. Here, we report an alignment-free full-resolution simultaneous fluorescence and quantitative phase imaging approach using single-pixel detectors. By combining reference-free interferometry with single-pixel detection, we encode the phase and fluorescence of the sample in two detection arms at the same time. Then we employ structured illumination and the correlated measurements between the sample and the illuminations for reconstruction. The recovered fluorescence and phase images are inherently aligned thanks to single-pixel detection. To validate the proposed method, we built a proof-of-concept setup for first imaging the phase of etched glass with the depth of a few hundred nanometers and then imaging the fluorescence and phase of the quantum dot drop. This method holds great potential for multispectral fluorescence microscopy with additional single-pixel detectors or a spectrometer. Besides, this cost-efficient multimodal system might find broad applications in biomedical science and neuroscience."
