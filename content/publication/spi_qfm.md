# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Multimodal microscopes either use multiple cameras or a single camera to multiplex different modes spatially. The former needs expertise demanding alignment and the latter suffers from limited spatial resolution. Here, we report an alignment-free full-resolution simultaneous fluorescence and phase imaging approach using single-pixel detectors. By combining reference-free interferometry with single-pixel imaging scheme, we employ structured illumination to encode the phase and fluorescence of the sample into two single-pixel detection arms, and then conduct reconstruction computationally from the illumination patterns and recorded correlated measurements. The recovered fluorescence and phase images are inherently aligned thanks to single-pixel imaging scheme. To validate the proposed method, we built a proof-of-concept setup for first imaging the phase of an etched glass with given etching depth and then imaging the phase and fluorescence of the quantum dot sample. This method holds great potential for multispectral fluorescence microscopy with additional single-pixel detectors or a spectrometer. Besides, this cost-efficient multimodal system might find broad applications in biomedical science and material science."
