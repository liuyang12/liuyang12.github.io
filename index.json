Though enjoying the advantages of low-bandwidth, low-power and low-cost, applying SCI to large-scale problems (HD or UHD videos) in our daily life is still challenging. The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms; they are either too slow (iterative optimization algorithms) or not flexible to the encoding process (deep learning based end-to-end networks). In this paper, we develop fast and flexible algorithms for SCI based on the plug-and-play (PnP) framework. In addition to the widely used PnP-ADMM method, we further propose the PnP-GAP (generalized alternating projection) algorithm with a lower computational workload and prove the *global convergence* of PnP-GAP under the SCI hardware constraints. By employing deep denoising priors, we first time show that PnP can recover a UHD color video ($3840\\times 1644\\times 48$ with PNSR above 30dB) from a snapshot 2D measurement. Extensive results on both simulation and real datasets verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Plug-and-Play Algorithms for Large-Scale Snapshot Compressive Imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[__Yang Liu__](https://liuyang12.github.io)\u0026ast;","[Xin Yuan](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/x.yuan)\u0026ast;","[Jinli Suo](https://sites.google.com/site/suojinli)","[David J.

Though exciting results of high-speed videos and hyperspectral images have been demonstrated, the poor reconstruction quality precludes SCI from wide applications.This paper aims to boost the reconstruction quality of SCI via exploiting the high-dimensional structure in the desired signal. We build a joint model to integrate the nonlocal self-similarity of video/hyperspectral frames and the rank minimization approach with the SCI sensing process. Following this, an alternating minimization algorithm is developed to solve this non-convex problem. We further investigate the special structure of the sampling process in SCI to tackle the computational workload and memory issues in SCI reconstruction. Both simulation and real data (captured by four different SCI cameras) results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm leads to significant improvements compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms. We hope our results will encourage the researchers and engineers to pursue further in compressive imaging for real applications.","tags":null,"title":"Rank Minimization for Snapshot Compressive Imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xukang Wang","[__Yang Liu__](https://liuyang12.github.io)","[Xiaofei Han](https://xiaofeitsinghua.github.io/)","[Jinli Suo](https://sites.google.com/site/suojinli)","[Qionghai Dai](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555200000,"objectID":"e5dd93a6a94792611f99066a54d395ff","permalink":"https://liuyang12.github.io/publication/sci_light-sheet/","publishdate":"2019-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sci_light-sheet/","section":"publication","summary":"We proposed a snapshot compressive volumetric light-sheet microscopy method for high-speed three-dimensional imaging of zebrafish and cleared mouse brain.","tags":null,"title":"Snapshot Compressive Volumetric Light-sheet Microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[__Yang Liu__](https://liuyang12.github.io)","[Jinli Suo](https://sites.google.com/site/suojinli)","[Yuanlong Zhang](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Yuanlong%20Zhang/YuanlongZhang.jsp)","[Qionghai Dai](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544400000,"objectID":"72fb8eda9f9a8f8d217d5d0eaae3cab6","permalink":"https://liuyang12.github.io/publication/spi_qfm/","publishdate":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spi_qfm/","section":"publication","summary":"Multimodal microscopes either use multiple cameras or a single camera to multiplex different modes spatially.

The imaging speed of CGI is limited by the modulation frequency of available SLMs, and sets back its practical applications. This paper proposes to bypass this limitation by trading off SLM’s redundant spatial resolution for multiplication of the modulation frequency. Specifically, a pair of galvanic mirrors sweeping across the high resolution SLM multiply the modulation frequency within the spatial resolution gap between SLM and the final reconstruction. A proof-of-principle setup with two middle end galvanic mirrors achieves ghost imaging as fast as **42 Hz** at 80 × 80-pixel resolution, **5** times faster than state-of-the-arts, and holds potential for one magnitude further multiplication by hardware upgrading. Our approach brings a significant improvement in the imaging speed of ghost imaging and pushes ghost imaging towards practical applications.","tags":null,"title":"High-speed computational ghost imaging via spatial sweeping","type":"publication"}]
