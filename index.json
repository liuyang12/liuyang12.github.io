The underlying principle of SCI is to modulate sequential high-speed frames with different masks and then these encoded frames are integrated into a snapshot on the sensor and thus the sensor can be of low-speed. On one hand, video SCI enjoys the advantages of low-bandwidth, low-power and low-cost. On the other hand, applying SCI to large-scale problems (HD or UHD videos) in our daily life is still challenging and one of the bottlenecks lies in the reconstruction algorithm. Existing algorithms are either too slow (iterative optimization algorithms) or not flexible to the encoding process (deep learning based end-to-end networks). In this paper, we develop fast and flexible algorithms for SCI based on the plug-and-play (PnP) framework. In addition to the PnP-ADMM method, we further propose the PnP-GAP (generalized alternating projection) algorithm with a lower computational workload. We first employ the image deep denoising priors to show that PnP can recover a UHD color video with 30 frames from a snapshot measurement. Since videos have strong temporal correlation, by employing the video deep denoising priors, we achieve a significant improvement in the results. Furthermore, we extend the proposed PnP algorithms to the color SCI system using mosaic sensors, where each pixel only captures the red, green or blue channels. A joint reconstruction and demosaicing paradigm is developed for flexible and high quality reconstruction of color video SCI systems. Extensive results on both simulation and real datasets verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Plug-and-Play Algorithms for Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Zhihong Zhang](https://github.com/zhihongz)†","[Chao Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GkAO16kAAAAJ)†","[__Yang Liu__](https://yangliu.mit.edu/)","[Xin Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cS9CbWkAAAAJ)","[Jinli Suo](https://sites.google.com/site/suojinli)✉","[Qionghai Dai](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn)"],"categories":null,"content":" bibtex @article{Li21SPY, author = {Zhang, Zhihong and Deng, Chao and Liu, Yang and Yuan, Xin and Suo, Jinli and Dai, Qionghai}, title = {Ten-mega-pixel snapshot compressive imaging with a hybrid coded aperture}, journal = {Photonics Research}, doi = {10.1364/PRJ.435256}, year = {2021}, month = {11}, volume = {9}, number = {11}, pages = {2277--2287}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1364/PRJ.435256}, publisher = {Optica Publishing Group}, type = {Journal Article} }  ","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"5d3241290284ad63db57453e95715dd5","permalink":"/publication/sci_hybrid/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sci_hybrid/","section":"publication","summary":"High-resolution images are widely used in our everyday life; however, high-speed video capture is more challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at the high-resolution mode. The main bottleneck lies in the low throughput of existing imaging systems. Toward this end, snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of imaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction. During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a single measurement. Then, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video frames from the coded snapshot. Recently developed plug-and-play algorithms made the SCI reconstruction possible in large-scale problems. However, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI’s wide application. Thus, in this paper, we build, to the best of our knowledge, a novel hybrid coded aperture snapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid crystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement a PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high-quality reconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we obtain a 10-mega-pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high throughput of 4.6×109 voxels per second. Both simulation and real-data experiments verify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.","tags":null,"title":"Ten-Mega-Pixel Snapshot Compressive Imaging with a Hybrid Coded Aperture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Xin Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cS9CbWkAAAAJ)","[__Yang Liu__](https://yangliu.mit.edu/)","[Jinli Suo](https://sites.google.com/site/suojinli)","[Qionghai Dai](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn)"],"categories":null,"content":" bibtex @inproceedings{Yuan20PnPSCI, author = {Yuan, Xin and Liu, Yang and Suo, Jinli and Dai, Qionghai}, title = {Plug-and-Play Algorithms for Large-scale Snapshot Compressive Imaging}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)}, doi = {10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00152}, year = {2020}, month = {6}, pages = {1447 -- 1457}, arxiv = {2003.13654}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00152}, publisher = {IEEE/CVF}, type = {Conference Proceedings} }  ","date":1592006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592006400,"objectID":"d85878bef204c751e5abaee5a2dd5b5e","permalink":"/publication/sci_pnp/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sci_pnp/","section":"publication","summary":"Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) aims to capture the high-dimensional (usually 3D) images using a 2D sensor (detector) in a single snapshot.

We build a joint model to integrate the nonlocal self-similarity of video/hyperspectral frames and the rank minimization approach with the SCI sensing process. Following this, an alternating minimization algorithm is developed to solve this non-convex problem. We further investigate the special structure of the sampling process in SCI to tackle the computational workload and memory issues in SCI reconstruction.

The imaging speed of CGI is limited by the modulation frequency of available SLMs, and sets back its practical applications. This paper proposes to bypass this limitation by trading off SLM’s redundant spatial resolution for multiplication of the modulation frequency. Specifically, a pair of galvanic mirrors sweeping across the high resolution SLM multiply the modulation frequency within the spatial resolution gap between SLM and the final reconstruction. A proof-of-principle setup with two middle end galvanic mirrors achieves ghost imaging as fast as **42 Hz** at 80 × 80-pixel resolution, **5** times faster than state-of-the-arts, and holds potential for one magnitude further multiplication by hardware upgrading. Our approach brings a significant improvement in the imaging speed of ghost imaging and pushes ghost imaging towards practical applications.","tags":null,"title":"High-speed computational ghost imaging via spatial sweeping","type":"publication"}]
