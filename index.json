Though exciting results of high-speed videos and hyperspectral images have been demonstrated, the poor reconstruction quality precludes SCI from wide applications.This paper aims to boost the reconstruction quality of SCI via exploiting the high-dimensional structure in the desired signal. We build a joint model to integrate the nonlocal self-similarity of video/hyperspectral frames and the rank minimization approach with the SCI sensing process. Following this, an alternating minimization algorithm is developed to solve this non-convex problem. We further investigate the special structure of the sampling process in SCI to tackle the computational workload and memory issues in SCI reconstruction. Both simulation and real data (captured by four different SCI cameras) results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm leads to significant improvements compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms. We hope our results will encourage the researchers and engineers to pursue further in compressive imaging for real applications.","tags":null,"title":"Rank Minimization for Snapshot Compressive Imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[__Yang Liu__](https://liuyang12.github.io)","[Jinli Suo](https://sites.google.com/site/suojinli)","[Yuanlong Zhang](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Yuanlong%20Zhang/YuanlongZhang.jsp)","[Qionghai Dai](http://media.au.tsinghua.edu.cn)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544400000,"objectID":"72fb8eda9f9a8f8d217d5d0eaae3cab6","permalink":"/publication/spi_qfm/","publishdate":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spi_qfm/","section":"publication","summary":"Multimodal microscopes either use multiple cameras or a single camera to multiplex different modes spatially.

The imaging speed of CGI is limited by the modulation frequency of available SLMs, and sets back its practical applications. This paper proposes to bypass this limitation by trading off SLM’s redundant spatial resolution for multiplication of the modulation frequency. Specifically, a pair of galvanic mirrors sweeping across the high resolution SLM multiply the modulation frequency within the spatial resolution gap between SLM and the final reconstruction. A proof-of-principle setup with two middle end galvanic mirrors achieves ghost imaging as fast as **42 Hz** at 80 × 80-pixel resolution, **5** times faster than state-of-the-arts, and holds potential for one magnitude further multiplication by hardware upgrading. Our approach brings a significant improvement in the imaging speed of ghost imaging and pushes ghost imaging towards practical applications.","tags":null,"title":"High-speed computational ghost imaging via spatial sweeping","type":"publication"}]
